# DISCORD BOT IN PYTHON


## Hey Guys !!

--> In this project, I just wanted to make a Discord Bot in Python
--> To enable this project on your Discord Server, you have to follow some instructions ;
        
## First, Download

--> In first time, you have to download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (the LTS version) and an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) ! 


## Next, you simply have to follow instructions in the code
  
  1. Go on [Discord Developper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  2. Choose or create a new application (If you need help to create your first application, follow the next step)
  3. You can add a profile picture. To do it, go on "**Bot**", click on "**Icon**" and upload a new Icon
  4. Next, click on "**Copy**" below "**TOKEN**". If there is not this button, click on "**Reset Token**" and the button will display.
  5. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file named "**bot.py**" and paste the code in

## To finish complete the code !

  1. Now you have to edit some lines ;
        - First, you have to complete **""** after "**command_prefix**" by the prefix that you choose and the same for the description like that:
          ```python
          bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "!", description = "Hey, I'm a new Discord BOT !"
          ```
  2. To finish, you have to complete the last line by the token of your Discord BOT like here:
     ```python
     bot.run('Enter here your bot's token')
     ```
  3. After that, debug your code in VSC on "**Debug**" and click on "**Start Debugging**"
